A Scottish twist on the alternative reality world of Hearts of Iron 4 modding scene

A very early version of an alternative reality world whereby Scotland attained Independance in 1936, and what that world might look like today.
Completely fictional, just a bit of fun.

Hearts of Iron 4 is a WW2 Strategy game that kicks off in 1936. It can be purchased on Steam for PC.
